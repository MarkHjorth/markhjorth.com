        Blomsterhaven Aalborg Website
      </h1>
      <p>This website was created for the Aalborg based daycare Blomsterhaven Aalborg.</p>
      <p>It takes advantage of a fresh and modern design to get the point across.</p>
      <p>Blomsterhaven Aalborg is a private daycare in the center of Aalborg.</p>
      <p>The daycare is in a cozy apartment and lies close to woods and green areas, aswell as the zoo.</p>
